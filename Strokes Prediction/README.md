# Projects
Machine learning projects developed out of public datasets.

# Context: 

    # According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible 
    # for approximately 11% of total deaths.
    # This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, 
    # various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

# Objective: 

    # Our top priority in this health problem is to identify patients with a stroke.

# Dataset used: 

    #Strokes Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

#Evaluation:

    # For evaluation tecnics we are going to use Recall instead of F1-score (suggested by the kaggles author)
